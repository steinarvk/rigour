What is it?
-----------

It's a JSON validation and "post-parsing" library for Python.

Why?
----

It's an attempt to make conversion of complex JSON objects to
native, meaningful Python objects, and back again easy to do
robustly.

This will hopefully make it easier to write JSON APIs that
have really stellar error handling.
