What is it?
-----------

It's a JSON validation and "post-parsing" library for Python.

Why?
----

It's an attempt to make conversion of complex JSON objects to
native, meaningful Python objects, and back again easy to do
robustly.

This will hopefully make it easier to write JSON APIs that
have really stellar error handling.

The fine print
--------------

This library was written by me (steinarvk@) while an employee of Google.
Due to various legal intricacies, Google claims copyright to the code.
The code is open sourced under the Apache 2 license, so this should
not be a hindrance to anyone wishing to use the code.

Although contributions are very welcome, there are unfortunately
some legal hoops to jump through if you wish to contribute.
See CONTRIBUTING.md for details.

This code was written in my spare time. It is in no sense an official
Google product, or even an unofficial one.
